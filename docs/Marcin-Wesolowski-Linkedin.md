## Summary

#### I am a tech entrepreneur with 20 years of experience in building and

#### growing IT companies. As the founder of EstiCRM, I bootstrapped

#### this profitable company to a 30% market share and over 5M PLN

#### in annual recurring revenue (ARR), while maintaining a record-

#### low churn of ~1%. My journey with the company culminated in a

#### successful full exit in 2025.

#### Currently I serve as a Strategic Advisor and Co-founder. I combine

#### business strategy (Product-Market Fit, GTM) with technical

#### proficiency (AI-driven, Spec-Driven Agentic Coding) to help startups

#### transform their vision into profitable and scalable SaaS products.

#### Having previously led a digital agency for a decade and delivered

#### over 200 projects for enterprise brands and startups, I bring a unique

#### dual perspective on technology and business growth
